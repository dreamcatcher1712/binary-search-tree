BINARY SEARCH TREE:
Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.
It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a maximum of two children.
It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.
